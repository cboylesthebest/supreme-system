## ðŸ“‹ BODIUM Assessment Recommendations

Based on my initial assessment, I strongly recommend implementing an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**.
Given that you already have a protocol in place to notify end users following a breach, having an IDS will 
ensure you're promptly alerted when such an event occurs. Without one, a threat actor could potentially
compromise your systems and remain undetected, increasing the risk of significant damage.

- To strengthen Botium Toysâ€™ overall security posture, I recommend several targeted enhancements:
  - Implement the principle of **least privilege** to minimize unnecessary access and reduce the risk of internal misuse.
  - Introduce or refine a **disaster recovery plan** to ensure operational resilience in the event of system failure or breach.
  - Enforce strong **password policies** alongside a **password management system** to promote secure authentication practices.
  - Deploy an **IDS** and support legacy systems with **manual monitoring and maintenance** to improve threat visibility.
  - Incorporate robust **encryption protocols** to safeguard sensitive data across systems and communications.

- To align with industry-recognized best practices, ensure full adherence to the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**:
  - Restrict credit card data access to **authorized personnel only**.
  - Securely **store, process, and transmit** sensitive payment information.
  - Implement robust **encryption protocols** for transaction data.
  - Enforce comprehensive **password management policies**.

- To better align with **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** requirements:
  - Ensure that all personal data belonging to EU customers is **securely stored, classified, and inventoried**.
  - Enforce clear **privacy policies and documentation procedures**.
  - Establish a **formal breach notification plan** to inform EU customers within 72 hours of any compromise.
  - Demonstrate a strong commitment to **data privacy and responsible stewardship**.

- To strengthen the internal control environment and build stakeholder trust, maintain compliance with **SOC Type 1 and Type 2** standards:
  - Document and enforce **user access policies**.
  - Ensure the **confidentiality of sensitive data** (such as PII and SPII).
  - Validate and maintain **data integrity** to confirm accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
  - Ensure **authorized individuals** have timely access to the data they need.
  - Promote operational **transparency, security, and accountability**.
